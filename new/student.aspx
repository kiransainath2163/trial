    From the very beginning, BVRIT has sought to establish a connection between living and learning.  At BVRIT Campus, learning together has meant living together. The special residential system provides students more than simply a place to live. By design, residential life that brings together students and faculty is an essential part of the learning experience. Many of the students choose to live on campus for their full undergraduate careers.<br /><br />
    BVRIT’s extracurricular and co-curricular opportunities are  virtually unlimited. The College provides considerable  support to student clubs and other activities, and both  novices and accomplished practitioners find opportunities  to participate and explore. Indeed for many students  extra-curricular activities contribute to the rich  community  life of the College. Whatever your interests,  whether sport, music or community service there will be  many opportunities to make the most of your time in   BVRIT. If what you want to do is sit and read books, the  libraries and the spaces will make this the perfect place to  do so. For most, it provides experiences and friendships  that will last a lifetime.
