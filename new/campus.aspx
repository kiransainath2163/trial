    BVRIT is located near a small town called Narsapur about 75 minutes from Hyderabad on the Bus. Spanning over 110 acres of land away from the din of the city, this campus trains approximately 4500 students and nurtures them through their path to education and enlightenment and empowers them for the challenges beyond. BVRIT is surrounded by lush green forest. If you like to spend your time, there's always something to keep you entertained – whether that's having coffee with friends, catching a film, boating, or getting involved in clubs and societies.<br />
