    <b><h2><font color="darkblue">Center for Cognitive Sciences:</font></h2></b><br />
    The Cognitive Science Research Initiative is one of the latest ventures taken up by BVRIT. The lab is being headed by Dr I.A.Pasha who is also the head of the Electronics and Communication Engineering department. The lab boasts of the prestigious DST fund which primarily aims at building brain-computer interfaces for people with no muscle control. In addition to this major project, students are encouraged to come up with their own ideas and extensive support is given to expand their ideas, carry out their own research work and conduct experiments. BVRIT proudly claims to be one of the very few colleges in India to have established a Cognitive Science lab which is a virginal ground, especially in India.<br /><br />
    <b>Objectives of the centre</b><br /><br />
    The center focuses research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within human nervous systems and machines (e.g. computers).
