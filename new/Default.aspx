    Go solar is the new mantra at B V Raju Institute of Technology with the installation of rooftop solar photovoltaic plant on their buildings. BVRIT would be harnessing solar power to the tune of over 100kWp solar power from this month onwards.

In its pursuit to become energy efficient, Padmasri Dr.B.V.Raju Institute of Technology (BVRIT) of Sri Vishnu Educational Society, Narsapur, Medak, Telangana formally commissioned a 100kWp Solar PV Plant on 12th of November, 2013. This project is the first of its kind among all the JNTUH affiliated colleges in Andhra Pradesh. The plant consists of a total 400 PV modules each of 250Wp supplied by SIRIUS Solar Energy, Hyderabad, installed at rooftop of Aryabatta Block in BVRIT. The entire project is executed by EPC contractor, M/s. Solaris Innovations & Systems, Hyderabad

Mr. N. Ramchander, the Project Coordinator at BVRIT said “This plant will generate more than 1.5 lakh units every year. Average monthly power generated is approximately 12600 KWH. The plant provides substantial cost savings on the power consumption for the College”.
