    <b><h2><font color="darkblue">Training and Placement Cell</font></h2></b><br />
    The Training and placement Cell is committed to provide all possible assistance to its students in their efforts to find employment. This commitment is demonstrated by the existence of a full time professor in charge. The benefits of this assistance are reflected in the preparation of students who were able to secure lucrative and esteemed positions in recent years. The Training & Placement service operates year round to facilitate contacts between companies and graduates. Staffs are available to respond to student's question and concern of all kinds. The aim is to ensure that students have the information and skills necessary for an effective job search.<br /><br />

    <b><h2><font color="darkblue">Summer Training</font></h2></b><br />
    <p>Each student has to undertake summer training in companies of repute for duration of 6-8 weeks. Students are required to work on projects given to them either by the sponsoring organization or selected by the students themselves. The project report/thesis is an intensive learning exercise for students to apply particular theoretical concepts into practical situations as experienced in an industrial milieu. The final placement of students is a strategic activity for BVRIT and all the processes are towards the same. Keeping in mind the existing and expected job opportunities, we plan to provide placement services to our participants. For effective placements, we establish close ties with the companies, which are in the process of providing jobs to our students. The existing placement cell keeps intensive interface with leading corporate/ consultants.</p>
    <br />
   <p>BVRIT students gain valuable work experience through the internships provided, especially if students are looking to work in a specific career field. Since relevant work experience is one of the key qualifications companies look for when comparing candidates for a job or internship, completing several internships during college greatly increases the chances of being selected for a job after graduation. BVRIT believes even though its students gain the knowledge required for succeeding in a specific career through their college courses and curriculum, internships are one of the best ways to develop the required skills necessary to gain the experience required to be successful in the field.</p>
    <br /><b><h2><font color="darkblue">Final Placement</font></h2></b><br />
    <p>Campus recruitment drives are undertaken by inviting companies from the private, public and government sectors to place Institute's students at entry level positions. Placement assistance is provided industry/sector/Vertical-wise as well as by functional area wise. </p>
