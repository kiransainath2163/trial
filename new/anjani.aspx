    <p>Anjani Powder Research Center (APRC) is a state-of-the-art facility for research & development in powder materials and associated processing technologies. Having its origin in the Integrated long term program on cooperation with Sri Vishnu Educational Society and Anjani Portland Cement Limited, APRC became operational in November 2009.</p><br />
   <p>Translating Research to Technology has been APRC motto and the Centre has set for itself the task of striving to bridge the gap between conventional research institutes and the industries. Consistent with this overall goal, APRC has dedicated its efforts toward achieving the technology transfer to the industry.
APRC focuses on research in powder technology, cement testing and powder characterization such as surface area, particle size, shape, particle size distribution, hausner ratio, compressibility, zeta potential, angle of repose, repose density surface charge and cohesiveness.</p><br />
    <p>The Centre has been continuously striving to provide most cost-effective solutions to industry for various problems. This is being achieved through the execution of projects like enhancing powder characteristics, mill circuit analysis, powder process design and analysis, performance and evaluation studies of filters, centrifuges, cyclone separators, storage and mass flow of silos.
Research facilities:</p><br />
   <p>Powder Characterization Instruments, Powder Preparation machines, Compressive Strength Machine, Furnaces, Mixers, Humidity Chambers, Image Analysis, Chem. Cad, MAT LAB.</p>
